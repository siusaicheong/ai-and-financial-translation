# Artificial Intelligence and Financial Translation

Author: SIU Sai Cheong (September 2023)

## Abstract

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the generative language models driven by deep learning and empowering chatbots such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have unlocked exciting opportunities for translation technology. These advances could offer immense value to specialized fields, including financial translation, which plays a critical role in ensuring transparency in Hong Kongâ€™s financial market and enhancing its position as an international financial hub.

In light of these developments, this talk aims to explore how cutting-edge AI technologies can contribute to innovation in technology for financial translation. It will begin with an overview of financial translation in Hong Kong and recent breakthroughs in AI, with a focus on the design and use of deep artificial neural networks. This will be followed by a demonstration of custom-built AI-driven translation applications that leverage these networks, illustrating how such tools can facilitate a range of translation-related tasks in the context of financial translation.

This talk will offer insights into how financial translators can capitalize on state-of-the-art language applications in the era of generative AI. These tools could complement widely-adopted resources such as machine translation for general translation, translation memories, and terminology databases, potentially transforming the ways in which professional translators and AI work together for improved cross-lingual communication in the financial world.
